	<h1>Requirements</h1>
</div>

<div class="container">
	<div class="well">
		<p><span class="text-primary"><b></span></b>
		<ul>
  <li>A macOS or Linux computer (windows futurerestore does not have support for libipatcher)</li>
  <li>The ipsw file of the version you want to go to. You can download firmware files from <a href="https://ipsw.me/">ipsw.me</a></li>
  <li>Futurerestore+libipatcher. You can download it from <a href="http://api.tihmstar.net/builds/futurerestore/futurerestore-latest.zip">here</a></li>
  <li>Your shsh file. See how to check for blobs here(soon)</li>
  <li>Your device must be jailbroken and with tfp0 patch or hgsp4 patch. Most jailbreaks are ready for this. Check if your jailbreak supports the patches <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tfp0_patch">here</a></li>
<h1>Procedure</h1>
  </div>
  <li>On your device, open Cydia and add this repo: repo.tihmstar.net</li>			
  <li>Install "Kdfuapp" from the previously added repo. If your device is not supported, check the bottom of this page to find another method.</li>	
  <li>Open the app and follow on screen instructions.</li>
  <li>After your device shows a black screen, press any button (home,power), connect it to computer and check if iTunes recognized it as a dfu mode device.</li>
  <li>If iTunes did not detect your device, hard reboot and try again</li>	
  <li>If iTunes recognized your device, extract futurerestore on your desktop</li>	
  <li>Put the ipsw and the shsh file in the same folder of futurerestore. I suggest renaming the ipsw to "ipsw.ipsw" (without quotes) and the shsh file to "shsh.shsh" (without quotes)</li>		
  <li>Open a new terminal window and cd into the futurerestore directory. Example: "cd /Users/Yourname/Desktop/futurerestore" </li>
  <li>Give futurerestore_macos or futurerestore_linux the correct permissions. Example: "chmod +x futurerestore_macos"</li>
  <li>Now execute futurerestore. Example: "./futurerestore_macos</li>	
  <li>It will show the usage options. Check if it says "odysseus support:yes" so you're ready to go.</li>
 
  <li>If your device is an iPhone or iPad cellular, read the text below:</li>
  <li>iPhone/cellular iPad --->give the command to downgrade. Example: "./futurerestore -t shsh.shsh --use-pwndfu --latest-baseband ipsw.ipsw"</li>	
  
  
  <li>If your device is a wifi iPad or an iPod, read the text below:</li>
  <li>iPod/wifi iPad--->give the command to downgrade. Example: "./futurerestore -t shsh.shsh --use-pwndfu --no-baseband ipsw.ipsw</li>
 
<li>Press enter and wait for it to complete. If iTunes opens, close it.</li>
<div class="container">
	<h1>Note 1: What to do if KDfuApp does not support your device:</h1>
  </div>
  <li>KDfuApp does not support every device, but don't worry: there's another method to get into pwned dfu mode.</li>	
  <li>Download kloader from tihmstar repo (if you have iOS 9.x or lower) or download <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WTehoZ_on74J4EbDyo5YzUVNGMeBIEaL">this</a> if you are on iOS 10.x</li>	
  
		<li>If you are on 10.x and downloaded the file, extract it and put "kloader" in /usr/bin folder on your device. You can use filza (on device) or any tool (from pc) to move files in your iphone. Then install any terminal from cydia (Mterminal is good), login as root, and execute "chmod +x /usr/bin/kloader". </li>	
  <li>Now go <a href="http://albyvar.github.io/ibss">here (soon)</a> and download the pwned iBSS file for your device.</li>
  <li>Put the ibss file in /var/mobile/documents on your device and name it "ibss" without any extension.</li>
  <li>Now open a terminal and execute "cd /var/mobile/documents" and then "kloader ibss". </li>  
  <li>Your device will show some text and then will boot to a black screen. After 10 seconds press any button and you can continue reading the tutorial.</li>  
<div class="well">
<div class="container">
	<h1>Note 1: What to do if futurerestore says "abort trap 6" or complains something about keys:</h1>
  </div>
  <li>That happens when keys for your device are not available on the ipsw.me api. No worry, there's a workaround.</li>	
  
  
		<li>If you are on 10.x and downloaded the file, extract it and put "kloader" in /usr/bin folder on your device. You can use filza (on device) or any tool (from pc) to move files in your iphone. Then install any terminal from cydia (Mterminal is good), login as root, and execute "chmod +x /usr/bin/kloader". </li>	
  <li>Now go <a href="http://albyvar.github.io/ibss">here (soon)</a> and download the pwned iBSS file for your device.</li>
  <li>Put the ibss file in /var/mobile/documents on your device and name it "ibss" without any extension.</li>
  <li>Now open a terminal and execute "cd /var/mobile/documents" and then "kloader ibss". </li>  
  <li>Your device will show some text and then will boot to a black screen. After 10 seconds press any button and you can continue reading the tutorial.</li>
