        The iPhone 5 model 5,2 (i'll add 5,1 ipsw later) on 10.3.x
        kloader modified to work with helix jb (thanks @nyan_satan): https://t.co/hoIMFYzCsf

        Pwned ibss: https://t.co/FANcsi2WYS
        My modified ipsw: 
        
So, to start:

copy the kloader binary and the pwned ibss on the device with iFunbox or something similar
Open a terminal and do chmod +x kloader (specify where kloader is etc..)
now do kloader ibss_5 (or whatever you called ibss)
wait for the device to shut down, and after some seconds press any button.
Connect the device in dfu mode to the pc.
Open terminal and do ./idevicerestore -t iPhone5,2_8.4.1_NoSetup.ipsw
Now do: ./idevicerestore -w iPhone5,2_8.4.1_NoSetup.ipsw
Wait for it to complete the restore
Done.

NOTE: I know this tutorial is not well made, when i have some more free time i'll make it better.
Another thing: re-distributing ipsw is illegal. But for now I think it's the only solution to avoid users from downloading tons of material and fuck up things.
